# Employee Tracker Panel


# Background

Welcome to my employee tracker application. This is almost similar to a project i made a few weeks ago. This time we are not generating a team. This app keeps track of all your of all employees, departments, jobs, salaries, and ids. You have the option to view add and update anything you want. I plan to add more features such as removing roles, departments, viewing employees by manager and viewing budgets of a department. I also hope to fix the feature of updating employee roles.
